# Human Emotion Detection using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on recognizing human emotions from facial expressions using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on labeled facial images and tested for accuracy in detecting various emotions.

## Features
- CNN-LSTM based emotion classification
- Preprocessing and augmentation of facial expression datasets
- Evaluation and performance analysis

## Installation & Setup
To set up the environment, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python
```

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of facial expression images categorized into emotions (angry, happy, sad, etc.).

## File Structure
